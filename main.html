	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Analyzing time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that run faster and make better use of resources.</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm to execute completely. It is commonly expressed as O(n), which indicates that the space required grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
